# KAVI GPT :P
Kavi is an small local llm assistant.
I basically use it for text-summarization and text-generation.
This should work with any model locally, just make sure you update the 
`~/.kavi/config.json` which has model configuration.

# Setup
```sh
$ pip install .
```

`~/.kavi/config.json` has config

# Run
```sh
$ kavi
```

Note: if virtualenv is causing issues, failing to locate packages
please try to run on your host machine if possible.
